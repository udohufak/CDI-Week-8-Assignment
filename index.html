          <div>The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), for the second time, has been ordered to call off its eight-month-old strike and resume work immediately by the Court of Appeal on Friday, in a three-member panel of the court ruling led by Justice Hamma Barka.

            ASUU got the first order to resume from the National Industrial Court on September 21, in a ruling delivered by Justice Polycarp Hamman, following an application that the Federal Government filed for an interlocutory order to compel the union to resume.
            
            The Federal Government&apos;s lawyer, Mr. James Igwe, contended that under Section 18(1)E of the Trade Dispute Act,  “employees could not continue a strike when a matter was already referred to the Industrial Court for adjudication”.
            
            Dissatisfied with the Industrial Court&apos;s ruling, ASUU headed to the Appeal Court to appeal the ruling and file a stay of execution of the ruling of the Industrial Court.</div>
